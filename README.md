## ðŸ¥ª Sandwich Delivery ðŸ¥ª
Submarine Delivery is a small project I am doing in my free time. The purpose is to learn go hopefully

The end goal is for the bot to be like the old Sandwich Delivery bot (or Virtual Diner Bot)

If you find any bugs, please [create an issue](../../issues/new)!

To run the bot, you need to have a bot token. You can get one by creating a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
After that you update the config with the correct information, then run the bot by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

``go run ./src/main``
